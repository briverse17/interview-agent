## Academic Projects

### Vi-Electra - Bachelor thesis
**Technologies:** tensorflow, torch, transformer, tpuv3
- Collected, processed, and tokenized nearly 60GB of Vietnamese text data
- Pre-trained ELECTRA models of three sizes (small, medium, large; 14M, 110M, 335M params, respectively) using Tensorflow on Google Cloud TPUs v3
- Fine-tuned the models for downstream tasks (POS-tagging, NER-tagging, Dependency Parsing, Natural Language Inference, and Hate Speech Detection) using both PyTorch and Tensorflow; the results were on par with Phobert (VinAI) and vElec (FPT Technology Research Institute)

### Vietnamese Speech Recognition
**Technologies:** torch, sklearn, sincnet
- Trained a Vietnamese Speech Recognition model according to the Sincnet architecture, with a dataset of 20 speakers using Pytorch

### Body posture recognition
**Technologies:** torch, wfdb, eeg
- Processed and converted raw sensor data to a readable format, then trained CNN models to map between gyroscope coordinates and body posture using Pytorch

### Covid-19 cases visualization
**Technologies:** tableau, seaborn, web-scraping
- Scraped Coronavirus cases data from Worldometer during a timespan of 30 days using BeautifulSoup4, then visualized the distributions and trends using Tableau and seaborn (Python)
